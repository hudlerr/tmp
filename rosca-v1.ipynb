    "## Model Introduction\n",
    "> ROSCAs are informal saving and credit institutions, whereby members pool together regular savings with are then dispersed to a member, either by random or based on the greatest need. This continues until every member has received the pot. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROSCAs are traditionally operated in small group within communities. I have found ROSCAs stand to be improved using blockchain technology - my review has demonstrated that blockchain technology certainly has the potential to create a more democratic, transparent truly peer-to-peer system. This has been proven by groups such as <a href=\"https://tlc.wetrust.io/\">WeTRUST</a> who are attempting to: `\"Create a blockchain-based Lending Circle dApp promoting financial inclusion and lay the groundwork for new financial tools for unbanked and underserved people throughout the world.\"` \n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored the profound social and economic implications of decentralized ledger technologies on ROSCAs, there is an implied pressing need for sustainable system design, which brings us to cadCad (complex adaptive dynamics Computer-aided design) which helps in designing, optimising, validating and understanding trivially non-complex, dynamical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## cadCad Overview\n",
    "cadCAD: Python library, assisting in the process of designing, testing and validating complex/economic systems through simulation. Allows you to ask powerful 'what-if' questions about your system, using simulation features such as A/B tests, parameter sweeps and Monte-Carlo analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "These 'what-if' questions can concern system internal factors (eg. agent behaviours, system parameters) or system external factors (eg. market conditions, competitive activity). cadCad can model systems with various levels of abstractions from micro-level agent modelling to macro-level system dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements Analysis\n",
    "Our goal for version 1 is to get an initial ROSCA circle running in a cadCad simulation environment. \n",
    "In this notebook, we want to: \n",
    "1. Present the dynamics of a single 'trusted' ROSCA circle on a peer-to-peer centralised network where agents share a common view of the chain \n",
    "2. Define simple strategies for agents to: intiate intial ROSCA circle, be set a contribution amount set by initiator, be allocated the pot in a random order\n",
    "3. Understand the basic space of decision making of several players in the protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, hopefully having demonstrated we can, in fact, reach our goal of `a fair, democratic, decentralised model solution of ROSCA`, we can build off of this version to implement:\n",
    "1. Neccessary mechanisms eg: voting, borrowing \n",
    "2. Design incentives\n",
    "3. Implement two types of circles (trusted & non-trusted)\n",
    "4. Understand how agent behaviours map to the incentives (rewards, penaties, general outcomes)\n",
    "5. Produce rich agent-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "1. What sort of mechanisms/incentives would we need to ensure agents parcipate in a way that fufils the systems goals\n",
    "2. What are the penalties to deincentivise dishonest behaviour\n",
    "3. What information is available to agents when their decisions are made\n",
